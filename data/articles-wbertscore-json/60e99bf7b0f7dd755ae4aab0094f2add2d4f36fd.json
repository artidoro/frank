Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment.", "entity_counter": {"The woman": 1, "premier league star Marcus Rojo": 8, "lines": 3, "a suspicious-looking white powder": 1, "Sarah Watson": 2, "a brief liaison": 1, "the Manchester United defender": 1, "a Christmas party": 1, "the team": 1, "the fling": 1, "a nightmare": 1, "the footballer": 2, "a suspicious white powder": 1, "Ms Watson": 2, "a driving licence": 2, "the unknown white powder": 1, "the glass table": 1, "The High Court": 2, "a gagging order": 2, "his representatives": 2, "a plot": 2, "a judge": 1, "the player": 1, "his cheating": 1, "his partner": 1, "her \u00a325,000 legal costs": 1, "the likes": 1, "the court case": 3, "a total nightmare": 1, "pictures": 1, "Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle": 1, "an unknown white power": 1, "Las Vegas": 1, "a kingsize roll-up": 1, "a scantily clad Ms Watson": 3, "a V-sign": 1, "the bonnet": 1, "a police car": 1, "A close friend": 1, "the Mirror": 1, "trendy spots": 1, "San Carlo": 1, "Neighbourhood": 1, "Manchester": 1, "a last-minute decision": 1, "a 'girls' night": 1, "six friends": 1, "Sarah": 1, "her gruelling legal fight": 1, "Manchester United's private Christmas party": 1, "a Manchester bar": 1, "her looks": 1, "his approach": 1, "her phone number": 1, "a more private party": 1, "a text": 1, "2am": 1, "a bit": 1, "an ego boost": 1, "a lot": 1, "young, pretty girls": 1, "a girlfriend": 1, "a taxi": 1, "the address": 1, "the flat": 1, "the centre": 1, "the city": 1, "a friend": 1, "court": 2, "Mr X": 1, "Kristian Bereit": 1, "a shocking proposition": 1, "Rojo's identity": 2, "a 'Premier League footballer": 2, "the details": 2, "sex": 1, "Marcos": 2, "a prostitute": 1, "a bedroom": 1, "money": 1, "any intention": 1, "the story": 2, "astonishingly explicit messages": 1, "naked photos": 1, "the might": 1, "the football club": 1, "the spoiled multi- millionaire player": 1, "lawyers": 1, "several Manchester United stars": 1, "extreme lengths": 1, "the papers": 1, "the national press": 1, "a scheming blackmailer": 1, "the affair": 1, "Rojo's wife": 1, "Eugenia Lusardo": 1, "Rojo": 2, "a lingerie model": 1, "this basis": 1, "the player's lawyers": 1, "a High Court order": 1, "People": 1, "our encounter": 1, "a lie": 1, "a kiss": 1, "the chance": 1, "some money": 1, "my personal training course": 1, "a single woman": 1, "[Rojo": 1, "his people": 1, "a greedy cow": 1, "hush money": 1, "Mr Justice Warby": 1, "a ruling": 1, "the High Court": 1, "the gagging order": 1, "Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs": 1, "The defender": 1, "the incident": 1, "his friend": 1, "Bereit": 1, "the money": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Sarah Watson , 34 , had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender .", "But the fling turned into a nightmare after she was falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3 100,000 from the footballer .", "High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson .", "Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson 's party girl lifestyle ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["sarah watson , 34 , had a brief liaison with manchester united defender .", "but the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort #
