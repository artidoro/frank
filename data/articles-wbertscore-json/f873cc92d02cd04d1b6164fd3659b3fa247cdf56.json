As 14million working households \u2013 more than nine in ten \u2013 are given an average boost of \u00a3200 a year to their incomes, the Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money \u2013 because they \u2018know best\u2019 how it should be spent. And he will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018crackpot Government schemes\u2019. \u2018There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers\u2019 money,\u2019 he will say. \u2018And we believe it\u2019s people \u2013 not politicians \u2013 who know best how to spend their own money. And that\u2019s what today is all about.\u2019 He will add that it is \u2018wrong \u2013 frankly immoral \u2013 for Government to spend money like it grows on trees\u2019. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub \u2018money back Monday\u2019, are: Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to \u00a315,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of \u00a317 a month. And nearly million pensioner households \u2013 more than nine in ten \u2013 will benefit by \u00a315 a month. Middle income households earning around \u00a323,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a \u2018better and fairer place to live\u2019, adding that low taxes \u2018go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. \u2018For me, there\u2019s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. \u2018There\u2019s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. \u2018But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong \u2013 frankly immoral \u2013 for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.\u2019 He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit \u2018without reaching into working people\u2019s pockets like Labour would\u2019. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are \u00a31,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: \u2018David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they\u2019ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? \u2018The truth is millions are worse off because of this government\u2019s choices. \u2018And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a \u00a33billion a year tax cut.\u2019 Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are \u00a31,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers \u00a3340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: \u2018In government, we secured a tax cut totalling \u00a3825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to \u00a312,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly \u00a3400.\u2019", "entity_counter": {"David Cameron": 3, "high taxes": 2, "14 million working households": 1, "a tax cut": 3, "wasteful government spending": 1, "working households": 1, "an average boost": 1, "their incomes": 1, "the Prime Minister": 1, "the Conservative case": 1, "people": 5, "their own money": 2, "a bold argument": 1, "continued lower taxes": 1, "bureaucracy": 1, "\u2018crackpot Government schemes": 1, "no such thing": 1, "public money": 1, "only taxpayers\u2019 money": 1, "not politicians": 1, "Government": 2, "money": 2, "trees": 2, "the raft": 1, "changes": 1, "effect": 1, "Mr Cameron": 2, "Other measures": 1, "saving": 1, "the Isa limit": 1, "the 10p savings tax band": 1, "Treasury analysis": 1, "the changes": 3, "14million working households": 1, "the tune": 1, "nearly million pensioner households": 1, "Middle income households": 1, "earners": 2, "the abolition": 1, "the old pensions annuities": 1, "retirement money": 1, "a current account": 1, "Britain": 1, "low taxes": 1, "the heart": 1, "a Conservative": 1, "the economic case": 3, "a competitive world": 1, "work": 1, "the best way": 1, "living standards": 1, "the money": 1, "the deficit": 1, "working people\u2019s pockets": 1, "Labour": 2, "a speech": 1, "Yorkshire": 1, "Shadow chancellor Ed Balls": 3, "figures": 2, "the Institute": 2, "Fiscal Studies": 2, "families": 2, "a result": 2, "government tax and spending changes": 2, "the Conservatives": 1, "VAT": 1, "George Osborne": 1, "the country": 2, "touch": 1, "The truth": 1, "this government\u2019s choices": 1, "millionaires": 1, "a \u00a33billion a year tax cut": 1, "The Lib Dems": 1, "income tax": 1, "part": 1, "their manifesto": 1, "24million taxpayers": 1, "Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg": 1, "government": 1, "ordinary working people": 1, "the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold": 1, "a further tax cut": 1}, "bart_lines": ["PM will set out Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money .", "He will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes , with less spent on ` bureaucracy ' and ` crackpot Government schemes ' Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of \u00a3 17 a month .", "Middle income households earning around \u00a3 23,000 a year will benefit the most , and the top ten per cent of earners the least ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["david cameron will say that high taxes are ` immoral ' as millions receive tax cut .", "he will say people ` know best ' how to spend their own money .", "will make bold argument for continued lower taxes , with less spent on ` bureaucracy ' and ` crackpot government schemes ' ."], "bus_lines": ["david cameron will say that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ` immoral ' as millions receive a tax cut .", "as 14million working households are given an average boost of #
