He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs. But the largest new-born lamb ever recorded there weighed just 15.5lbs.", "entity_counter": {"This bundle": 1, "joy": 1, "a special spring surprise": 1, "both his mother": 1, "the farmers": 1, "the 20lb": 1, "a gruelling three-hour birth": 1, "Shepherd John Hendy": 1, "a team": 1, "three helpers": 1, "mother Jean": 1, "the young lamb": 1, "Melton Mowbray": 1, "Leicestershire": 1, "black lamb Jean": 2, "Big Ben": 5, "twice the weight": 2, "all his brothers": 1, "sisters": 1, "the average weight": 1, "the 20lb lamb": 2, "peers": 1, "Proud mum": 1, "huge son": 1, "a three-hour labour": 1, "a Leicestershire farm Ben": 3, "the biggest lamb": 1, "this country": 1, "Jean Morris": 1, "either parent": 1, "the first time": 1, "a lamb": 1, "an experienced mother": 1, "a breeding ram": 2, "the hope": 1, "his amazing features": 1, "his future flock": 1, "86 ewes": 1, "no-one": 1, "a tup": 1, "his weight": 1, "the lambs": 1, "a person": 1, "the other 86 ewes": 1, "the same farm": 1, "Ben's arrival": 1, "the largest lamb": 1, "the UK": 1, "a massive 24lbs": 1, "north Wales": 1, "the heaviest lamb": 1, "the wild": 1, "Goliath": 1, "a hefty 22lbs 5oz": 1, "Wellington": 1, "Somerset": 1, "The title": 1, "the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb": 1, "Bruno": 2, "Worcestershire": 1, "a healthy 21lbs": 1, "the chop": 1, "his size": 1, "his owner": 1, "a pet": 1, "New Zealand": 1, "the world's biggest producer": 1, "lambs": 1, "the largest lamb born in the UK": 1}, "bart_lines": ["The 20 lb lamb was born at a farm in Melton Mowbray , Leicestershire .", "He is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him .", "The farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him , all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs .", "ben 's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the uk weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north wales ."], "bus_lines": ["suffolk black lamb jean deliver the young lamb near melton mowbray , leicestershire .", "he is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him .", "ben is seven years old and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild ."], "pgn_lines": ["jean morris from the farm said big ben was comfortably the biggest lamb ever born in this country .", "ben 's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the uk weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north wales .", "he was named the big one and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild ."], "s2s_lines": ["the UNK lamb was born in the uk at a whopping UNK in the uk .", "the UNK lamb is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him , all weighing the average weight of UNK ."], "article_lines": ["This bundle of joy was a special spring surprise for both his mother and the farmers who delivered the 20lb new-born after a gruelling three-hour birth.", "He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben.", "Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother", "but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs.", "Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers Proud mum:", "Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country", "but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered.
