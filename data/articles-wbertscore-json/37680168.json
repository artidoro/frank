Only senior managers are exempted.The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \"promising\", but it still leaves the NHS short.The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \"bank\" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \"league tables\" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors.
