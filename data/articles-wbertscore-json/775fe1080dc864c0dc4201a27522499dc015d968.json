Police raided the house of John Koepke, in Wittmann, Arizona and found 54 dogs and 18 cats living in disgusting, cramped conditions. Footage of the raid showed the animals clambering across the\u00a0furniture\u00a0as officers from Maricopa County Sheriff's Office making their way across\u00a0the\u00a0excrement\u00a0laden, urine-stained carpet to rescue the pets. Scroll down for video More than 70 animals have been seized from a filthy mobile home belonging to John Koepke who was banned from keeping pets One of the cats at the mobile home in Arizona was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies in a box Incredibly, one of the cats was found nursing a set of three young Chihuahua puppies. What happened to the Chihuahua's mother is not yet known. 'At least the cat was saving some animals,' said Sheriff Joe Arpaio in a press statement, 'I wont say the same thing for\u00a0this guy.' Another cat in the video appeared to have a serious injury to its left eye while the body of a further feline was also discovered at the home. Many of the animals seized appeared to be suffering with medical problems and are currently being assessed by\u00a0veterinary\u00a0experts. The incredible feline has taken over the role of mother for the three puppies - it is not known what happened the dog's biological parent Footage of the raid showed revealed the disgusting environment the pets were forced to live in such as excrement left on the floor 'Their eyes are matted shut and they're weeping,' Officer Christopher Hegstrom, spokesman for Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, told NBC News, apparently referring to the animals. Koepke had been 'highly emotional' and refused to surrender his animals to the deputies on Wednesday, calling them 'his children.' The 71-year-old had already been made subject to a ban which prevented him from keeping any pets until May 2015 after an animal hoarding case in 2011. He will be charged with 72 counts of failure to provide shelter and could face thousands in medical bills once the cats and dogs have been fully assessed.
