Shocked Terry Cooper, 79, was enjoying the sunshine in his garden with his dog Sam when the huge animal burst through a hedge with two cubs. Mr Cooper, from Curry Rivel, Somerset\u00a0said his dog  dragged him back indoors and fears he could have been attacked if his pet had not been there. Scroll down for video Shocked: Pensioner Terry Cooper said the huge badger burst through a hedge with two cubs (stock image) Mr Cooper spotted the huge badger while sitting in his garden in the sunshine with his Jack Russell Sam The retired charity worker said: 'I've got a little Jack Russell and I took him out just after tea at 5pm. 'Suddenly there was a badger and two little'uns in my garden. 'He was the size of a pig, with teeth about six inches long. They were as long as a lemonade bottle is wide.' 'My dog turned me round and quickly pulled me in,' Mr Cooper added.\u00a0'The badger didn't attack me, so I didn't seek medical attention, but I was left badly shaken. 'If I hadn't have had my dog there, the badger could have had me.' Following the scare, the National Farmers' Union has issued advice for residents on protecting their property from invading badgers (stock photo) He has covered the gap in his hedge with two pieces of metal and a bag of compost. Following the scare, the National Farmers' Union has issued advice for residents on protecting their property from invading badgers. Alex Stevens, South West regional policy advisor, said: 'Badgers are protected by law and people shouldn't be interfering with badgers or setts. 'This incident is really unusual and surprising, given the time at which it happened. But badgers are pretty headstrong. I suspect he was searching for an easy source of food. 'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it. 'People should also keep the lids on their bins, and if they have a dog or a cat, don't leave their food or water bowls out in the open.
