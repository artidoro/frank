The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.\u2019 Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The \u00a36million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: \u2018You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, \u201cWhat a player he is\u201d. \u2018If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.\u2019 Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank", "entity_counter": {"John Carver": 5, "former
