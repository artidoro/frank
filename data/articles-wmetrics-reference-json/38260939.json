of \u00a3345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - \u00a32m less than the record \u00a3347m allocated for the Rio Games.As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo.Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147.Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr

in the summer to have its funding removed.Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given \u00a35.74m in the last cycle.Christy said the decision represents

wrong?\" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin.Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly.Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly.\"We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,\" she said.\"If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk.\"Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: \"UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020.\"Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build \"performance pathways for future success\" was supposed to be aimed at such sports.A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: \"It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular

intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport.\"UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed.Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while
