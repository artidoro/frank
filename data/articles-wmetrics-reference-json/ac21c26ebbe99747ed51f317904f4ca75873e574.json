A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.' Manohar, of Barnston, Wirral, denies four counts of sexual assault. The trial continues.
