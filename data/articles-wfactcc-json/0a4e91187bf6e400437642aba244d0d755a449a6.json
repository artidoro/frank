Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports. Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy\u2019s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in. AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday Wright (centre) is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy. But his Sky employers vetoed the move. A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan. A Sandown spokesman said; \u2018Tony wanted to do it but his side are playing on Friday night and he just could not get back on time. Tony\u2019s wife will be at Sandown on Saturday along with Ian and his wife.\u2019 Another famous Arsenal name expected at Sandown is Liam Brady, one of McCoy\u2019s sporting heroes from his childhood. Wright was a player for Arsenal as a striker for seven years, from 1991 until 1998 Iconic Arsenal striker Thierry Henry (centre) was asked to present the award but Sky did not allow it Family commitments will keep McCoy away from the Emirates on Sunday when his team host Chelsea in a top of the table clash. He told Racemail: \u2018I have a kind invitation from the chairman to attend any home game before the end of the season.\u2019", "entity_counter": {"Arsenal legend Ian Wright": 3, "the man": 1, "AP McCoy": 6, "his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy": 1, "Sandown": 5, "Track officials": 1, "a connection": 1, "the club": 1, "the retiring rider": 1, "Wright": 1, "Arsenal": 3, "every scoring record": 1, "the book": 1, "McCoy\u2019s trophy": 2, "London": 1, "his BBC5Live radio phone": 1, "his final champion jockeys trophy": 1, "(centre": 1, "a television pundit": 1, "a huge Arsenal supporter": 1, "a home game": 1, "Thierry Henry": 1, "the Arsenal celebrity": 1, "his Sky employers": 1, "the move": 1, "A request": 1, "another Arsenal legend": 1, "Tony Adams": 2, "Gabala": 1, "Azabaijan": 1, "A Sandown spokesman": 1, "his side": 1, "time": 1, "Tony\u2019s wife": 1, "Ian": 1, "his wife": 1, "Another famous Arsenal name": 1, "Liam Brady": 1, "McCoy\u2019s sporting heroes": 1, "his childhood": 1, "a player": 1, "a striker": 1, "Iconic Arsenal striker": 1, "Thierry Henry (centre": 1, "the award": 1, "Sky": 1, "Family commitments": 1, "the Emirates": 1, "his team": 1, "Chelsea": 1, "a top": 1, "the table clash": 1, "Racemail": 1, "a kind invitation": 1, "the chairman": 1, "any home game": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Ian Wright will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at Sandown on Saturday .", "Wright played for Arsenal for seven years from 1991 until 1998 .", "McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["ap mccoy will be presented with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at sandown on saturday .", "track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports .", "wright had seven seasons at arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book ."], "bus_lines": ["ian wright has been confirmed as the man who will present ap mccoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at sandown on saturday .", "wright , who had seven seasons at arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book , will hand over mccoy 's trophy before heading back into london to present his radio phone in .", "ap mccoy is now a television pundit but played for arsenal during his years as a professional ."], "pgn_lines": ["ian wright confirmed as the man who will present ap mccoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at sandown on saturday .", "track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports .", "wright , who had seven seasons at arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book , will hand over mccoy\u2019s trophy before travelling back into london ."], "s2s_lines": ["ian wright will be presented with his final grand prix title at sandown on saturday .", "he will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by ian wright at sandown on saturday .", "he will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by ian wright at sandown ."], "article_lines": ["Arsenal legend Ian Wright has been confirmed as the man who will present AP McCoy with his 20th and final champion jockeys trophy at Sandown on Saturday.", "Track officials had been keen to secure someone with a connection to the club which the retiring rider fervently supports.", "Wright, who had seven seasons at Arsenal and broke every scoring record in the book, will hand over McCoy\u2019s trophy before travelling back into London to present his BBC5Live radio phone in.", "AP McCoy will be presented with his final champion jockeys trophy by Ian Wright at Sandown on Saturday Wright (centre)", "is now a television pundit but played for Arsenal during his years as a professional McCoy is a huge Arsenal supporter and has been invited to attend a home game before the end of the season", "Sandown initially tried to secure Thierry Henry to be the Arsenal celebrity to hand over the trophy to McCoy.", "But his Sky employers vetoed the move.", "A request to secure another Arsenal legend in Tony Adams also proved logistically impossible because he currently manages Gabala in Azabaijan.", "A Sandown spokesman said;
