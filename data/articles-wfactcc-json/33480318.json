If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.\"We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.\"England batsman Ian Bell: \"There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow.
