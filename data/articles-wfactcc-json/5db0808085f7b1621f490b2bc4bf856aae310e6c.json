complained. Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, \"See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.\"' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education. \u00a0The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference. Ledbetter said school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on a parent-teacher meeting. 'See, Obama is a baby killer.
