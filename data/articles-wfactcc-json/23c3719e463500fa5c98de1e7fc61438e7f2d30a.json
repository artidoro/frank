Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s absence to \u2018get to the bottom of the allegations\u2019. A CPS spokesman said: \u2018It is the DPP\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.\u2019", "entity_counter": {"Lord Janner": 7, "a letter": 1, "a
