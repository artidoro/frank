Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said.
