Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "entity_counter": {"Richie Benaud": 10, "a short battle": 1, "skin cancer": 2, "the man": 1, "an unrivalled blend": 1, "insight": 1, "authority": 1, "wit": 1, "commentary boxes": 1, "cricket matches": 1, "the globe": 1, "Sportsmail": 1, "his finest moments": 1, "his broadcasting career": 1, "cricket's great personalities": 1, "BALL": 1, "THE CENTURY": 1, "hand": 2, "viewers": 1, "Shane Warne's first test delivery": 1, "Australia": 3, "England": 3, "the 1993 Ashes": 1, "a stunning dismissal": 1, "Mike Gatting": 1, "AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud": 1, "his calming tone": 1, "broadcaster": 1, "his pure disdain": 1, "Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery": 1, "New Zealand": 1, "the worst things": 1, "a cricket field": 1, "the Channel Nine studio": 1, "LAST SPELL": 1, "COMMENTARY": 1, "ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties": 1, "Channel": 1, "the fifth Ashes Test": 1, "The Oval": 1, "members": 1, "the crowd": 1, "banners": 1, "tribute": 1, "YOU'VE": 1, "IF THEY'RE": 1, "Benaud's  cricketing knowledge": 1, "sharp turn": 1, "humour": 1, "an example": 1, "a player": 1, "a cricket ball": 1, "a place": 1, "ANDREW SYMONDS": 1, "A STREAKER": 1, "cricket's more bizarre moments": 1, "India": 1, "TRIBUTE": 1, "Channel Nine's powerful tribute": 1, "Phillip Hughes": 1, "GEOFFREY": 1, "DEREK RANDALL": 2, "a commentator": 1, "the uproar": 1, "GEOFFREY BOYCOTT": 1, "a modern day player": 1, "his batting partner": 1, "the reckless manner": 1, "Benaud's take": 1, "DON BRADMAN": 2, "SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection": 1, "Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities": 1, "cricket": 1, "his understanding": 1, "the game": 2, "the sport": 1, "the 3rd Test": 1, "the 1981 Ashes": 1, "Headingly": 1, "his best lines": 1, "AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER": 1, "Benaud's final pieces": 1, "work": 1, "Australia's cricketing summer": 1, "his home country": 1, "the World Cup": 1, "His enthusiasm": 1, "his voice": 2, "excitement": 1, "a broadcaster": 1, "memories": 1, "cricket's greatest moments": 1, "a media career": 1, "a magnificent player": 1, "AUSTRALIA": 1, "their domination": 1, "their success": 1, "a flamboyant, forward-thinking style": 1, "leadership": 1, "the first man": 1, "over 2,000 runs": 1, "more than 200 wickets": 1, "Tests": 1, "his finest dismissals": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Richie Benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .", "Benaud spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight , authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe .", "Sportsmail recalls 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .", "he was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his disdain for trevor chappell 's underarm delivery for australia against new zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable .", "benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket 's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between australia and india ."], "bus_lines": ["richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .", "benaud has died at age 84 for battling skin cancer ."], "pgn_lines": ["richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .", "benaud 's cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour , an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit ."], "s2s_lines": ["richie benaud dies at 84 after battling skin cancer .", "he was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record ."], "article_lines": ["Richie Benaud has passed away  at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer but the man who spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe will always be remembered.", "Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career.", "Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1.", "BALL OF THE CENTURY", "Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting.", "2.", "AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable.
