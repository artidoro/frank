Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through PayPal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe.com. Thats whats up. Bowe And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @JakeLeeYes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004\u00a0he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune. Holyfield beat Bowe the following year in a rematch and also scored several victories over Mike Tyson. But most of Holyfield's \u00a3150million fortune has now gone,\u00a0frittered away on gambling, funding three expensive divorces and maintenance payments for some of his 11 children.",
