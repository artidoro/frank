    "article": "Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after an evening in which their relegation into Sky Bet League One was marked by pre-match supporters' protests against Karl Oyston. Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen. 'We got off to a flyer and having got back to 1-1 I'm a little bit disappointed we didn't take anything on a horrible night on a horrible pitch.'",
