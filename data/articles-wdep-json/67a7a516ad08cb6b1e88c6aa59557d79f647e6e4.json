    "article": "Former Valencia striker Aritz Aduriz denied his old team victory with a last-gasp equaliser for Athletic Bilbao at San Mames Stadium. Aduriz pounced in the 90th minute to secure a 1-1 draw after Valencia had been reduced to 10 men. Nicolas Otamendi had harshly received a straight red card eight minutes earlier for a high challenge, and Valencia were unable to hold out in his absence. Athletic Bilbao Aritz Aduriz scored a 90th minute equaliser to deny his former club Valencia victory Substitute Rodrigo De Paul celebrates after coming on to give Valencia the lead Substitute Rodrigo De Paul had given the visitors a deserved lead 16 minutes into the second period, but even though they were unable to claim maximum points, a draw took them above Sevilla into fourth place in their pursuit of possible Champions League qualification. Getafe bolstered their hopes of securing Primera Division status for next season after moving 10 points clear of the bottom three by edging to a 1-0 win at struggling Elche. Fredy Hinestroza scored the only goal of the game with only five minutes remaining in a rare attack for Getafe, after the hosts had spurned a series of chances in the first half. Getafe celebrate after taking a step closer to survival by defeating Elche through\u00a0Fredy Hinestroza's strike Ecuadorian Felipe Caicedo scored twice for Espanyol in the 3-0 defeat of Villarreal Elsewhere, Espanyol extended Villarreal's winless streak to six games in all competitions as two goals from Felipe Caicedo handed the Catalans a 3-0 win at El Madrigal. Caicedo had a slice of fortune in opening the scoring as Javi Lopez's miscued header deflected off the Ecuadorian and he then thumped home his second of the evening after the break at Sergio Asenjo's near post. Asenjo had a night to forget as he also spilled Sergio Garcia's cross 11 minutes from time to allow Victor Sanchez to roll the ball into an empty net to complete Villarreal's misery.",
