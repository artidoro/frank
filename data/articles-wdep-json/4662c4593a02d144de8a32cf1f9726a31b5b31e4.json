Here is all the information you need for West Brom's home clash with Leicester... West Bromwich Albion vs Leicester City (The Hawthorns) Team news West Brom Craig Dawson is set to return for West Brom after serving a one-match ban. The defender missed last Saturday's 4-1 defeat to QPR but Youssouf Mulumbu was sent off in the game and starts a three-game ban against Barclays Premier League rivals Leicester. Craig Dawson brings down Manchester City's Wilfried Bony which earned him a retrospective red card for West Brom after Gareth McAuley (left) was mistakenly dismissed for the challenge Ben Foster is a long-term absentee with a knee injury while Callum McManaman is not yet fit despite closing in on a comeback after a foot problem. Provisional squad: Myhill, Rose, Gamboa, Pocognoli, Wisdom, Lescott, Dawson, Olsson, McAuley, Baird, Brunt, Morrison, Fletcher, Yacob, Gardner, Sessegnon, Berahino, Anichebe, Ideye. Leicester Matt Upson and Dean Hammond are available for Leicester's trip to West Brom. Defender Upson missed the 2-1 win over West Ham last week with an achilles problem while midfielder Hammond has been sidelined since January with a calf issue but both are back in training. Matthew Upson closes down a Leicester team-mate in training on Thursday and could face West Brom Boss Nigel Pearson has no further injury worries as his rock bottom side continue to fight for Barclays Premier League survival. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Schwarzer, Hamer, Simpson, Moore, Upson, Wasilewski, Morgan, Huth, De Laet, Konchesky, King, Hammond, Knockaert, Albrighton, Schlupp, Cambiasso, James, Mahrez, Nugent, Kramaric, Vardy, Ulloa.
