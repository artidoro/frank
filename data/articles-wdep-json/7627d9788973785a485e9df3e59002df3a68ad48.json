Scroll down for video If your name is Nigel you are twice as likely as the general population to vote Ukip, according to research. Pictured is Ukip leader Nigel Farage The study found that the three names most likely to vote Tory were Charlotte, Fiona and Pauline whereas those least likely to were Sharon, Samantha \u2013 unfortunately for the PM \u2013 and Clare without an i. The three most likely to vote Labour were Michelle, June and Andy and the least likely were Nigel, Nick and Jonathan. The most likely LibDem names were Tim, Kathryn and Samantha. The study comes just a day after it was revealed a Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'.",
