But \"honest people will not face any problem\", he added.After Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.Thousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.There are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.The 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of \"black money\" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.New 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.A new 1,000 rupee note \"with a new dimension and design\" will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.They can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.",
