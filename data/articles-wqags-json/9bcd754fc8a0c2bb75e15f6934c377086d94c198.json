A group called Community Technology Alliance is giving away free Google handsets which come loaded with apps that help the homeless find shelters, soup kitchens, and warn of severe weather. The phones are also designed to help people apply for jobs and find housing, as companies often require people to visit their websites. Holly Leonard (left), who was homeless and had spent time in prison, now has a house after finding an advert on Craigslist using a Google phone she was given to allow her to get online Holly Leonard, a homeless woman from San Francisco who has spent time in jail and in a women's refuge, has used her free handset to find herself a new home in San Jose, with her husband. She found the advert on Craigslist using a Nexus 5 phone she was given by the Community Technology Alliance. She told the New York Times: 'People don\u2019t put out \"for rent\" signs anymore, so the Internet is the best way. 'You can\u2019t even go get a paper application for a lot of things. You can\u2019t get a job unless you get online. Before I got a free phone, it was like you\u2019re almost nonexistent.' The Bay Area have one of the most acute homelessness problems in the U.S., with approximately destitute 14,000 people living in San Francisco and San Jose alone. While tech companies are keen to promote their image as compassionate businesses, tensions have boiled up over accusations they are not doing enough to help those in their own backyard.

Sam Dodge, a government worker who focuses on homelessness, added: 'Homeless people live in the year 2015, too, and people need cellphones.' Thanks almost entirely to the tech firms, the average person in Silicon Valley earned $116,033 last year, compared to $69,000 nationally, highlighting an ever-widening gap between rich and poor The phones are also used to help homeless people get in touch with their relatives, who they have often become estranged from, and may be able to help in getting their lives back on track. Users are provided with plugs for the phones, which they can use to recharge the batteries at coffee shops or in libraries for free. They are charged between $30 and $40 per month for internet, phone and call access, which is usually funded through voluntary schemes for which they are paid a stipend.
