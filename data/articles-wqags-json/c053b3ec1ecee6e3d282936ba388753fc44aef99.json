    "article": "Queensland toddler Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0Joughin was forced to use the room she was locked in as a toilet before dying in severe distress of internal injuries, a court has heard.Shocking allegations of the circumstances surrounding the three-year-old's 2013 death were revealed on Wednesday as family friend who was charged with the toddlers manslaughter was granted bail. The bail hearing revealed that Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0suffered blows to her stomach causing severe bowel damage- ultimately leading to her death. The bail hearing revealed Kyesha-Lee succumbed to massive bowel injuries after being struck days before her death Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin \u00a0was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail. Kyhesha-Lee's body was found - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013 Magistrate Rinaudo said he was ultimately swayed by Kent's steps towards taking responsibility for the 'tragic' events by his plea offer. Kent was bailed with strict conditions including daily reporting to police and restrictions on entering the homes of children under 16. Both he and Williamson are due to face a committal hearing next month. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",
