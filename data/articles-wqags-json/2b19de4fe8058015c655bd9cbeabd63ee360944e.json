Eric Garver, 21, was killed and\u00a0Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 was shot Musical team: The Gavers were part of a band called Matthew 24 Now, which sometimes played outside a grocery store in Boise, Idaho.\u00a0Above, a picture of the band from their Facebook page. Matthew 24 is a Bible verse dealing with the end of times Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle. Behind bars: The suspects who engaged in a shootout with police in a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart parking lot on Saturday have been identified as eight members of a Idaho family band. Above, two of the suspects, currently jailed: Jeremiah Gaver, 28 (left), and Nathaniel Gaver, 27 (right) Fighting cops: Police say the shootout was sparked by one of the Gavers pushing a Walmart store employee while trying to use the building's restroom.
