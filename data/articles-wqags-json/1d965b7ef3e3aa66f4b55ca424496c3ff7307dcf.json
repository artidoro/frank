    "article": "Baseball has long been considered America's favorite pastime, so it should come as no surprise that most people feel very strongly when it comes to their favorite professional team. And there are no two baseball teams that are greater, or more storied, than eternal rivals the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, who come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite. Also making a very impressive showing are the Texas Rangers and Atlanta Braves, who have fans across a wide area in the South. Then there are a few teams who don't get as much love - like the New York Mets. Scroll down for video A new Facebook graph reveals the favorite baseball teams in the country by sorting through people's likes and breaking down winners by county The New York Yankees (left) and Boston Red Sox (right) come in first and second respectively in terms of the number of people who claim them as their favorite The Mets are not the favorite team in one county in the country, with fans in their area seeming to all go for the Yankees. Same goes for the Oakland Athletics. The Toronto Blue Jays can also claim almost all of Canada, though the Yankees and Red Sox are also favorites in some areas. The graph, created by Facebook, uses profile likes and then breaks the individuals down by country to determine a winner. And with the exception of those aforementioned Yankees, Red Sox and recent World Series champs San Francisco Giants, who get some love in Hawaii, most teams only really get support near their home field.",
