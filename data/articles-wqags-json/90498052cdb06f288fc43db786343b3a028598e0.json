    "article": "Prisoner Carlos Boente (pictured) was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge A serving prisoner has been jailed for making a teenager's life a misery by bombarding her with thousands of texts after he received her number from a cellmate. Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'",
