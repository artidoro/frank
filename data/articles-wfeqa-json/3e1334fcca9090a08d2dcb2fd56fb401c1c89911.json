Swansea's Gomis unleashes a dangerous shot against Everton but only manages to injure his hamstring The Frenchman is treated on the sidelines after leaving the field during Swansea's 1-1 draw with Everton Gomis' injury has come at the worst possible time as he was finding his best form in a Swansea shirt after a difficult first season at the Liberty Stadium.
