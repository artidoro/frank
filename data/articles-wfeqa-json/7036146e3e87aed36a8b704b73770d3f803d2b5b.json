The loophole came to light after trading standards officers raided restaurant The Royal China Club, on Baker Street in central London, and confiscated illegally imported fins. Charity Bite-Back, which campaigns to protect sharks, reported the eatery after Jason Chan, its marketing manager, boasted that it sold the soup and another dish made with ground shark teeth. Scroll down for video The revelations come after the Royal China Club, a restaurant in central London, was raided by inspectors after boasting of selling shark fin soup and another dish made from ground shark teeth Charity workers say that restaurants are either disguising the soup (pictured) on their menus as 'fish fin soup', or are offering it to Mandarin speaking customers if they ask More than 70 million sharks are killed each year for their fins, often dying slow, painful deaths after being dumped back into the sea once their most valuable parts have been cut off. Graham Buckingham, campaign director at Bite-Back, told The Times he was disappointed that The Royal China Club was not fined for their breach. He added: 'There's never any big penalty for this type of discovery and even if trading standards had chosen to prosecute, the fines are described as minimal.' Charity Bite-Back believes as many as one in five Chinese restaurants are selling the soup after exploiting a loophole which allows people to bring 20kg of fins into the country if they are for personal consumption While conducting research for a recent report, Mr Buckingham's charity discovered a legal loophole allowing for 20kg of shark fin to be brought into this country if it is for personal consumption. Just one kilogram of shark fin can fetch up to \u00a3180 through wholesale markets. He said as many as one in five Chinese restaurants could be offering the dish, but many disguised it as 'fish fin soup' or did not put it on the menu, but offered it to Mandarin speaking patrons.",
