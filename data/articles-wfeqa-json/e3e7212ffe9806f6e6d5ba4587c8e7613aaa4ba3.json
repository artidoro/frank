James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too. 'Luckily she wasn't.'", "entity_counter": {"A schoolboy": 1, "a rare illness": 1, "sunlight": 3, "the street": 1, "the brown suncream": 1, "James Creag": 2, "the special cream": 1, "meaning": 1, "the condition": 3, "Erythropoietic Protoporphyria": 2, "whose victims": 1, "their skin": 1, "direct sunlight": 1, "the special brown suncream": 1, "a rare sunlight": 1, "allergy": 1, "terrible sunburn": 1, "sunlight James": 1, "Salford": 1, "Greater Manchester": 1, "Dundee Reflective Sunscreen": 1, "a thick brown paste": 1, "the light": 1, "strangers": 1, "abuse": 1, "chocolate face": 1, "his unusual appearance": 1, "His mother": 1, "Claire": 2, "the cream": 2, "names": 1, "a racist": 1, "either ignorance": 1, "evilness": 1, "People": 1, "people": 1, "the mickey": 1, "The unfortunate schoolboy": 1, "a long-sleeved shirt": 1, "trousers": 1, "gloves": 2, "all weather": 1, "the sun": 1, "boiling water": 1, "his condition": 1, "his parents": 1, "specially dimmed windows": 1, "the sun's rays": 1, "His school": 2, "new lightbulbs": 1, "Mrs Creag": 4, "pins": 1, "needles": 1, "his body": 1, "agony": 1, "a reaction": 1, "the new daylight bulb lights": 1, "a special coating": 1, "Family": 1, "James": 7, "his mother": 2, "younger sister Grace": 1, "EPP": 1, "a build-up": 1, "a chemical": 1, "the blood": 2, "The skin": 1, "longer ultraviolet wavelengths": 1, "UVA": 1, "visible light": 1, "a shortage": 1, "an enzyme": 1, "the body": 1, "the protoporphyrin": 2, "a substance": 1, "a result": 1, "this enzyme deficiency": 1, "protoporphyrin levels": 1, "blood": 1, "the skin": 2, "the energy": 1, "a chemical reaction": 1, "tissues": 1, "The nerve endings": 1, "itching": 2, "pain": 2, "the blood vessels": 1, "fluid": 1, "swelling": 1, "The condition": 1, "symptoms": 1, "burning": 1, "no cure": 1, "Source": 1, "British Skin Foundation": 1, "football": 2, "the garden": 1, "my husband": 1, "Daniel": 2, "his hands": 2, "boxing gloves": 1, "the cold tap": 1, "His skin": 1, "sunburn": 1, "three times the size": 1, "The family": 1, "their GP": 1, "grass": 1, "steroid tablets": 1, "the swelling": 1, "the doctors": 1, "Painkillers": 1, "allergy tablets": 1, "any exposed skin": 1, "his face": 1, "hands": 1, "no sun cream": 3, "any difference": 1, "hospital": 1, "the rare condition": 1, "a hat": 2, "scarf": 1, "every inch": 1, "his skin": 1, "her joy": 1, "her daughter": 1, "Grace": 2, "the illness": 1, "the genetic risks": 1, "tribute": 1, "his bravery": 1, "your typical 11-year-old lad": 1, "his shoulders": 1, "other kids": 1, "the sunshine": 1, "Doctors": 1, "his EPP": 2, "an inherited condition": 1, "a variant gene": 1, "a mutant gene": 1}, "bart_lines": ["James Creag suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria .", "It means his skin can not be exposed to direct sunlight .", "He was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen , a thick brown paste .", "But when strangers shouted out abuse such as ` chocolate face ' because of his unusual appearance , he refused to wear it any more ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["james creag , 11 , suffers from the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria .", "it means he suffers from terrible sunburn when exposed to sunlight .", "he was given dundee reflective sunscreen , a thick brown paste which blocks out the light .", "but when strangers shouted abuse such as ` chocolate face ' and ` you 're coloured ' because of his unusual appearance , he refused to wear it any more .", "he has to wear a long-sleeved shirt , trousers , and gloves in all weather", "so he is not harmed by the sun ."], "bus_lines": ["james creag must use the special brown suncream as he suffers from a rare illness which means he is allergic to sunlight has been racially abused in the street because of the brown suncream he has to wear .", "james , from salford in greater manchester , was given dundee reflective sunscreen , a thick brown paste .", "his mother claire , 34 , said : ` when he had the cream on he was called names ' , he refused to wear it any more ."], "pgn_lines": ["james creag , 11 , is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream -
