Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court\u00a0after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it. Adeli has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK and was also placed on a 10 year sexual offences prevention order", "entity_counter": {"the moment": 1, "a paedophile": 1, "police": 5, "a girl": 4, "the
