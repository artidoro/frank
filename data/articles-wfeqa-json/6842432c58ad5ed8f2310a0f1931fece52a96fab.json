Football League board member Jim Rodwell\u2019s departure from Notts County to become chief executive of Scunthorpe has created the need for an election for a League One representative as Rodwell cannot automatically keep his place. League One clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat \u2014 Rodwell and former Manchester United director Maurice Watkins, now chairman of Barnsley. Tony Fernandes, owner of QPR, wants to avoid fines of up to \u00a350million for Financial Fair Play breaches Maurice Watkins is a sports lawyer whose firm represents QPR over their considerable FFP troubles QPR are 19th in the Premier League, four points away from escaping the relegation zone Watkins is a sports lawyer and his firm Brabners are representing QPR over their considerable FFP troubles. Clubs believe that having Watkins on the Football League board, where FFP is the hot topic, would be helpful for QPR and a massive conflict of interests. However, the highly-respected Watkins, who has a number of sporting directorships including British Swimming and Lancashire County Cricket Club, dismissed the conspiracy theory as \u2018wholly ludicrous\u2019. Raheem Sterling\u2019s stand-off with Liverpool over a new contract is not just to do with him. It will suit Sterling\u2019s representative Aidy Ward, who split with Rob Segal\u2019s Impact Sports Management to set up on his own earlier this season, if any new deal is delayed until his parting from Segal has been finalised. Aidy Ward (left) is Raheem Sterling's agent and is a key player in his contract negotiations with Liverpool Raheem Sterling (left) pictured with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) at Liverpool training The five former England managers who signed the letter supporting Greg Dyke\u2019s homegrown players\u2019 campaign had nothing to do with writing the missive. It was the work of the FA\u2019s support agency on the issue, Milltown Partners. Certainly, Sven Goran Eriksson and Kevin Keegan  did nothing for the homegrown situation when club managers \u2014 Keegan even shut down Newcastle reserves. Greg Dyke, the Football Association chairman, wants to more homegrown players playing in England Kevin Keegan's name is one of five former England managers to sign a letter supporting Dyke's idea However, Milltown are at least helping the FA fight the PR battle toe-to-toe against the all-powerful Premier League, who ironically have used Milltown for crisis management advice in the past. England cricket head coach Peter Moores\u2019 considerable good fortune at surviving such a World Cup humiliation extends to the ECB board meeting reviewing that debacle being next Thursday. By then Moores will be preparing for the first Test against West Indies starting four days later. England cricket head coach Peter Moores (right) will soon begin a review into England's World Cup failure Moores (left) oversaw England's humiliating group stage exit from the Cricket World Cup If the postmortem had occurred earlier it is difficult to see how Moores could still be in charge. The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live\u2019s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin\u2019s Hotel Carlina after the England game. Green was overheard at reception moaning it was BBC\u2019s responsibility to settle the bill and not his. But Green eventually had to cough up\u2026all of seven euros.
