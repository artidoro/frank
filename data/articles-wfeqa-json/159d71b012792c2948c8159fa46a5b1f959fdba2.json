The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: \u2018True compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance.\u2019 He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning \u00a387 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not \u2018playing the system\u2019 but were \u2018victims of it\u2019. He said they were \u2018victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers\u2019. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net \u2013 not a web from which no-one could escape. \u2018So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. \u2018It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don\u2019t you dare lecture us on poverty. \u2018And know this \u2013 the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.\u2019 Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. \u2018For many second earners, work didn\u2019t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. \u2018In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That\u2019 s right \u2013 30 hours of free childcare a week \u2013 worth \u00a35,000 to working families. \u2018That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year \u2013 nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs \u2013 all by 2017.\u2019 Mr Cameron also argued \u2018that true compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance\u2019. The new free childcare will be available where all parents in the household are working at least eight hours a week at the minimum wage. The new 30 hours entitlement will cost just under \u00a3350 million a year.", "entity_counter": {"David Cameron": 1, "a furious attack": 1, "Labour MPs": 1, "poverty": 4, "more than a million people":
