The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to \u00a34,000 at the auction on Saturday Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to \u00a32,000. The actor is also selling paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware and a fine collection of crystal chandeliers. Diorama: The 3D model was commissioned specially by Mr Hardy from artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s Close-up: The piece was rendered in amazing detail showing the progress of the battle in 1415 Luxurious: A view of many of the items of furniture and other antiques which are being sold Dozens of books, some dating back to the 17th century, are included in the auction which is set to take place this Saturday. A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.' Historical: An early 20th-century painting of Alfred the Great rebuilding London, by Frank Owen Salisbury Auction: The objects are being sold at Dominic Winter in Gloucestershire on Saturday Pride: Mr Hardy pictured in 2012 with the longbow and other objects from his collection He has built up the haul of antiques thanks to his interest in classic literature and military history. Mr Hardy was taught by Tolkien and C.S. Lewis when he studied English at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he has published two books on the history of the longbow. He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose. Mr Hardy, a close friend of Richard Burton, worked with top actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Judi Dench during his early days as a Shakespearean specialist. He found national fame playing vet Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the hit BBC drama which aired between 1978 and 1990 and also starred Lynda Bellingham.
