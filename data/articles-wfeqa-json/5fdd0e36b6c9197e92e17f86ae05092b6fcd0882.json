Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.", "entity_counter": {"A Saudi Arabian man": 1, "the Mexican border": 1, "Saudi Arabian": 3, "rape charges": 1, "Utah": 7, "Monsour Alshammari": 2, "the U.S.": 1, "a Saudi government student sponsorship": 1, "ties": 1, "the country's royal family": 1, "court documents": 2, "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement": 1, "a judge": 1, "Provo": 1, "an arrest warrant": 1, "the border": 1, "San Diego": 2, "charges": 1, "the rape": 1, "a student": 1, "Alshammari": 6, "rape": 1, "a first-degree felony": 1, "justice": 1, "a second-degree felony": 1, "a plea": 1, "charges related to the rape of a student in February": 1, "Prosecutors": 1, "no concern": 1, "his bail": 1, "a facility": 1, "Orem police Lt.": 1, "Craig Martinez": 1, "process": 1, "Utah police": 1, "bail": 2, "his international connections": 1, "willingness": 1, "$100,000 bail": 1, "prosecution": 1, "Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson": 1, "KSL.com": 1, "no way": 1, "his ties": 1, "the royal family": 2, "a woman": 1, "police": 2, "a date": 1, "The victim": 1, "this apartment complex": 1, "Utah Valley University": 1, "the Utah County jail": 1, "Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich": 2, "his client": 1, "the arrest": 1, "Alshammari's connections": 1, "any relationship": 1, "connections": 1, "attorney client privilege": 1, "Police": 1, "details": 1, "the royal connection": 1, "federal officials": 1, "royalty": 1, "family connections": 1, "the Saudi Arabian government": 1}, "bart_lines": ["Monsour Alshammari , 27 , is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country 's royal family , according to court documents .", "He was arrested on Friday at the Mexican border and is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February ."], "bert_sum_lines": ["monsour alshammari , 27 , is in the u.s.", "on a saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country 's royal family .", "he was picked up by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement on friday and a judge in provo signed an arrest warrant on monday to extradite him back to utah .", "he had been charged on april 3 with rape , a first-degree felony , and obstructing justice , a second-degree felony ."], "bus_lines": ["monsour alshammari , 27 , is in the u.s.", "on a saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country 's royal family .", "he was picked up by u.s. immigration on friday and a judge signed an arrest warrant on monday to extradite him back to utah .", "he is being held at a facility in san diego until he can be extradited to utah ."], "pgn_lines": ["monsour alshammari , 27 , is in the u.s.", "on a saudi government student sponsorship .", "he was picked up by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement on friday and a judge in provo signed an arrest warrant on monday to extradite him back to utah .", "alshammari had been charged on april 3 with rape , a first-degree felony , and obstructing justice , a second-degree felony .", "he has not yet entered a plea to those charges ."], "s2s_lines": ["UNK UNK , 27 , was arrested on friday at the border near san diego .", "he is set to be extradited to utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in february ."], "article_lines": ["A Saudi Arabian man has been arrested at the Mexican border after attempting to flee the country to avoid facing rape charges in Utah.", "Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents.", "He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah.", "Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego.", "He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February", "Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony.", "He has not yet entered a plea to those charges.", "Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail.", "He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah.", "Orem police Lt.", "Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks.", "Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution.
