Sterling, the England international who will lead Liverpool\u2019s line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday. Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes.

Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about this instance \u2014 (but) how it gets framed is totally different.\u2019 Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard, available after a three-match suspension, an immediate recall against Villa, making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign. They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January, but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress. Reds have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension \u2018When you get so close, whether it was in the title race or the cup, it hurts,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018Trace back the winners in sport. If you look at everything they have won, also look at what they have lost. You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on. \u2018Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals.
