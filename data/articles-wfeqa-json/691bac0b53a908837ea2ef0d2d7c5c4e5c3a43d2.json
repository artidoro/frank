Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects \u2013 including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video\u00a0Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn\u2019t had [my friend\u2019s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly\u00a0visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.", "entity_counter": {"A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises": 1, "skin": 2, "complexion": 1, "clients": 4, "a waiver": 2, "their personal information": 3, "a funeral director": 3, "a coroner": 3, "Skin Laundry": 3, "their Light and Laser procedure": 1, "your skin": 1, "long-term use": 1, "wrinkles": 1, "clear acne": 1, "scarring": 2, "these claims": 1, "the quickie treatment": 1, "paper": 1, "that paper": 1, "the mandatory eight-page contract": 1, "one client": 1, "the New York Post": 1, "a Dickens novel": 1, "wording": 1, "the possible death": 1, "the client": 1, "skin-obsessed New Yorkers": 1, "the Manhattan location": 1, "video Risky regimen": 1, "Skin Laundry's popular laser facial": 1, "rare, potential risks": 1, "crusting": 1, "itching": 1, "pain": 1, "bruising": 1, "skin whitening": 1, "hyperpigmentation": 1, "burns": 1, "infection": 1, "scabbing": 1, "swelling": 1, "the waiver clients": 1, "an iPad": 1, "their treatments": 1, "course": 1, "the more fatal risks": 1, "Clients": 4, "identification purposes": 1, "grant permission": 1, "their organs": 1, "such ominous language": 1, "fans": 1, "the 'addictive' procedure": 1, "fact": 1, "the clinic": 3, "its hours": 1, "order": 1, "its bookings -
