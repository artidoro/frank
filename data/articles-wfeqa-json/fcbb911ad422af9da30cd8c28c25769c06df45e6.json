One doting dad has been teaching his son how to 'magically fly'. YouTube videos show four-month-old Noah Monte perfectly balancing on the palm of his father's hand as he's lifted through the air. As he whizzes up and down, the infant manages to keep his legs and body upright. His outstretched arms help him to remain airborne. Caught on camera: YouTube videos show four-month-old Noah Monte perfectly balancing on the palm of his father's hand as he's lifted through the air Bystanders are heard laughing in the background as they watch the tot in action. Noah apparently started performing the 'circus act' when he was just one-month-old. However, as he was still wobbly on his legs he was lifted low to the ground. He also clung on to one of his father's hands for extra support. Perfect balance: As he whizzes up and down, the infant manages to keep his legs and body upright Crowd pleaser: Bystanders are heard laughing in the background as they watch the tot in action When his balance started to improve, Noah mastered the stunt hands-free. But now, more than a year on, it appears he could be getting a little too heavy for his father to lift in the palm of his hand. New videos show the infant getting up to more grown-up antics from 'riding shotgun on a skateboard' to tucking into a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Noah's parents describe him as having a 'fun' and 'crazy' adventurous spirit.
